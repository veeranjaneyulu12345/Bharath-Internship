House Price Prediction
Overview
Welcome to the House Price Prediction project! This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting house prices using Python, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow. Predicting house prices is a common and essential task in the real estate industry, and machine learning can provide valuable insights and accurate predictions based on historical data.
Project Structure
   The project is organized into the following directories:

   data: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the machine learning model.
   notebooks: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, model development, and evaluation.
   src: Python source code for building and training the machine learning model.
   models: Saved models and model artifacts.
